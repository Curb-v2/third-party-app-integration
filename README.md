# Curb Integrations
Examples and documentation for third party apps integrations with Curb.  There are couple of skeleton example apps to help get you started:

* [Basic web app](https://github.com/Curb-v2/third-party-app-integration/tree/master/web-app) - a straightforward web app that consumes the Curb API on the server side.
* [Simple browser client](https://github.com/Curb-v2/third-party-app-integration/tree/master/simple-browser-client) - a serverless browser client that connects to the Curb API.
